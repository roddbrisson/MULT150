Q. Is the game too easy or hard?

A. I feel like the game is too easy.


Q. What would make it easier or harder?

A. Perhaps having the chaos balls turn off the goal for one second anytime it hits them would make it harder.


Q. What would give it a "wow" factor?

A. Maybe have some type of feature to stun the choas balls for three seconds.
   The color balls will still bounce off the chaos balls, but the goals are safe for a bit.


Q. What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?

A. It seems the Bumper does not have a real purpose to the game.
   I could keep the bumper still and the color balls will eventually hit the goals.
